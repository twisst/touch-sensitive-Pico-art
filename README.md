# touch-sensitive-Pico-art
Making touch-sensitive artworks using Raspberry Pi Pico.

This repo contains the software used in my workshop for students of the Royal Academy of Art in The Hague. 

I also turned the step-by-step guide for those workshops into an Instructable:

My script uses Circuitpython and the touchio and synthio libraries, as well as libraries from Adafruit.

Thanks to Todbot for this very helpful page:

Touchio documentation:

In the UF2 file I included the Adafruit libraries, but if you need to uses the latest version of them then you can find them here:
